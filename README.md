## Project Overview
In 2021, 77% of India's prison population consisted of undertrial prisoners (UTPs). These individuals face significant challenges in accessing legal resources, education, and rehabilitation programs. Our project aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive platform that connects UTPs with legal services, educational resources, and support systems, empowering them to navigate their legal journeys more effectively.

## Features
1. Lawyer and Legal Services Connection
Connect with Lawyers: UTPs can easily connect with lawyers, clinics, and government legal experts.
Filter Lawyers: Lawyers can be filtered based on location, expertise, services offered, and authenticity verified via the Bar Council.
NGOs and Counselors: Access a network of NGOs and counselors, along with reviews and ratings from other users.
2. Information and Awareness
Stay Informed: Keep up with the latest news, laws, and virtual court services relevant to undertrial prisoners.
eCommittee Integration: Leverage the eCommittee platform for legal proceedings, aid in securing bail, and addressing complaints.
3. Case Tracking and Dashboard
User-Friendly Dashboard: Track the status of legal cases with a user-friendly dashboard designed for ease of use.
4. Educational Support
Machine Learning Recommendations: Our system uses machine learning algorithms to recommend educational materials tailored to the needs of UTPs.
Simulations and Workshops: Engage in learning through simulations and live workshops to improve language and numeracy skills.
Leaderboard System: Implement a leaderboard to recognize and encourage achievements in educational and skill-building activities.
